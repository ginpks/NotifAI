# VIEWING DOCUMENTATION
1. View documentation on SmartBear's API Hub w/ Swagger platform
```
   https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/universityofmassachu-4ab/notif-ai_backend_server_api/1.0.0
```
   (NOTE: this will be read only, to edit, see colalborating on swagger, also there is some bug that prevents enums of request/response bodies from displaying,
    I recommend using the option to open the html file NotifAI/server/api_documentation.html containing docs on a browser instead)
   
4. Open NotifAI/server/api_documentation.html on browser, an image is included in OVERVIEW section
   
# OVERVIEW
Backend REST API documentation developed using Swagger's API Hub. Swagger is a part of SmartBear, a company for developing software quality tools. 
Swagger is a tool for designing REST API's that are Open API compliant. Open API is a set of specifications on how to document and design an API 
that is widely accepted by developers. The documentation is represented in a json file.

This file path is the Open API compliant documentation with all the endpoints and data models of the backend
```
NotifAI/server/universityofmassachu-notifai-server-1.0.0-resolved.json
```

This file path is the html file that is a more interactive documentation, open this in a browser such as Chrome
```
NotifAI/server/api_documentation.html
```

Both of these files were generated from Swagger's API Hub
